# Quick Tutorial
## User Registration and Activation
To use the BCO Portal (<i>formerly BCO Editor</i>), a user must login to the portal using the login credentials. Login credentials can be created through the registration form present on the home page. A user must register himself to generate the credentials for logging in to the portal.  Once a user registers himself on the portal, the user account needs to be activated by the BCO-DB admin. For the downloaded instance of the BCO Portal the instructions, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/bco_editor#admin-utility).

## User Login
Enter the login credentials into the designated login email and password fields. After successful login, the page navigates to the BCO Portal search page where a new BCO can be created or existing BCO can be searched.

## Creating a new BCOs
To create a new BCO click on the link “Create Object”. By clicking the link, the page navigates to the BCO Portal interface page where a new BCO can be created. This page displays the editable domains a BCO should have, based on the defined schema. Each field has its short description that helps the user to enter the correct value in the field. All the domains of the BCO can be collapsed and expanded as needed. The BCO can be also be created/edited by editing the JSON using the option “Edit JSON” in the BCO Portal interface page.

To view an example of the BCO click [here](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/examples/blob/master/HCV1a.json) and to know more about the BCO or BCO domains [click here](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md).

## Viewing the BCO
The BCO edited in the BCO Portal can be viewed in the JSON format by clicking “View Object”. To return to the edit mode click on “Edit Object”

## Saving the BCO
Once all the values have been entered in the BCO editor, click on “Save Changes” to save and create the BCO.  Once the BCO is saved, the default BCO ID -1 gets changed to a next available positive ID.

## Searching existing BCOs
The existing BCOs can be searched using the search fields of the portal. The portal allows to search the BCOs by their BCO ID or by the BCO name.  Select one of the search options and enter the search value accordingly. Click on the ‘Search’ button to search the existing BCOs matching the entered BCO ID or BCO name.

To view or edit the BCO retrieved by the search, click on the object from the search list displayed on the page.
